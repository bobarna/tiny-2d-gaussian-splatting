# Tiny Gaussian Splatting in 2D

Splatting 2D Gaussians to represent images. Tiny, self-contained, and minimal
implementation in a single Jupyter notebook.

## Install dependencies

TLDR: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Using `pip` and `venv`:
1. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
2. Activate this environment:
```
# MacOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Once activated, `pip` will refer to packages installed in the `venv` folder
(e.g. `venv/lib/python[your-version]/site-packages`)

3. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. (Optional) Include specific version numbers from
   `backup-requirements-frozen-versions.txt`

5. You can deactivate the virtual environment using ```deactivate```

## Run Jupyter notebook locally
```
jupyter notebook
```
